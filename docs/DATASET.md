# Data Preparation

**ShanghaiTech** anomaly dataset can be reached from [here](https://svip-lab.github.io/dataset/campus_dataset.html)

**UCFCrime** dataset can be reached from [here](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/) or from the [repo](https://github.com/WaqasSultani/AnomalyDetectionCVPR2018).


### Motion Representations

We used star and dynamic image representations as motion representations. The code for generating the represenations and feature extraction can be found in [main/motion_representains](/motion_representations/).


## Note:
To the preprocessing and autoencoder parts, one can refer to the work in [here](https://github.com/AnilOsmanTur/video_anomaly_diffusion).
